This is the README file for Slash::OurNet, a Slash 2.0+ plug-in
that allows OurNet connectivity to various BBS and NNTP systems,
by Elixir Group and OurInternet Inc.

* Installation

You could either copy the whole distribution under the plugins/
directory before installing Slash, or use the standard perl module
install process:

cpansign verify
perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

and then use the bin/install-plugin utility (usually located in
/usr/local/slash/bin/) to install it as a feature of your site.

Alternatively, you may also run the ourinet.pl file independently
from a mod_perl or CGI environment.  If you don't have a web
server handy, use this to create a dedicated HTTP::Daemon server:

perl ournet.pl -d

If you are only interested in serving your local BBS to yourself,
try this:

perl ournet.pl -d -l

Please remember to change the ournet.conf settings to suit the
specific configurations of your bbscomd daemon. See related 
documentations in the OurNet::BBS distribution for an overview.
